## Before Reset

Remeber to always backup or upload local stuff that you care about. Here are a few reminders of what you might lose otherwise.

- Local databases and app configurations: eg. `Transmit.app` favorites and `mysql` databases.
- Remember to check all GIT repositories for uncommitted changes.
- Make sure editor settings are synced.

Last but not least, you should probably reconsider applications, binaries and tools in `scripts`.
